# Sorting Algorithms Performance Evaluation

This repository describes implementations of sorts and performance comparison of five sorting algorithms namely Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. It is to test how long it will take to execute them when applied to random data sets of different lengths.

***Following sorting algorithms have been implemented:***

 1. **Selection Sort:** A simple comparison based sorting algorithm which works on the following principle again and again:  Find the minimum element from the remaining part of the list and exchange it with the left most element which  is currently unsorted. 
 2. **Bubble Sort:** A simple comparison based sorting approach which is also known as  sinking sort which repeatedly moves through the list and compares two consecutive elements and swaps them if they are in  wrong order. 
 3. **Insertion Sort:** Sorting algorithm which is also based on comparison, which creates the  sorted list one element at a time and puts the current element at the appropriate position within the already sorted  part. 
 4. **Merge Sort:** Sorting algorithm which is based on the divide and conquer approach where the list  is first divided into two halves, both of which are sorted recursively and then both the sorted halves are  merged. 
 5. **Quick Sort:** Sorting algorithm which is also based on divide and conquer approach in which an  element is picked as pivot, the array is divided based on the pivot element and the subarrays are  then recursively sorted.
